# MAVLink ZKP Proxy üïõ - Midnight Network Enabled Telemetry and Consensus in Decentralized Drone Swarm Control üõ∏ü§ñ
A decentralized drone swarm control system using MAVLink, Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and the Midnight Network for secure telemetry and fault-tolerant consensus.

## Project Overview üåê
This project aims to create a **decentralized and secure drone swarm control system**. By leveraging **MAVLink** for communication, **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** for privacy, and the **Midnight Network** for decentralized consensus, we ensure that the system is fault-tolerant and capable of secure operations in real-time.

### Key Features üîë
- **MAVLink Telemetry**: Real-time telemetry integration for drone communication.
- **ZKP-based Privacy**: Protects sensitive data and allows selective disclosure of information.
- **Midnight Network Integration**: Blockchain-based consensus ensures fault tolerance and decentralized decision-making.

## Architecture Overview üèóÔ∏è

The **MAVLink ZKP Proxy** project is built on the following key components:

1. **MAVLink Protocol**: MAVLink is a lightweight messaging protocol used for communication between drones and the ground control system (GCS). It provides the necessary telemetry and command structure for controlling drones.
2. **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: ZKPs ensure that sensitive drone data is shared securely, allowing for selective data disclosure without revealing the full data set.
3. **Midnight Network**: Built on Cardano, the Midnight Network offers a decentralized, fault-tolerant consensus mechanism that allows drones to make collaborative decisions autonomously.

### System Flow Diagram üìà
- **Step 1**: Drones exchange telemetry data using MAVLink.
- **Step 2**: Privacy is enforced using ZKP, ensuring sensitive data is protected.
- **Step 3**: The Midnight Network facilitates real-time consensus between drones, allowing for decentralized decision-making.
- **Step 4**: Telemetry data is visualized and logged via the dashboard, giving the operator real-time insights.

## Use Cases üåç

This project can be applied across various industries:
- **Search and Rescue Operations**: Autonomous drone swarms can collaborate to search large areas, sharing critical location data securely while making real-time decisions.
- **Surveillance and Security**: Drones can monitor sensitive locations, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to surveillance data through ZKPs.
- **Agriculture**: Agricultural drones can autonomously monitor crop fields, analyze data, and make decisions about watering, fertilization, and more, all in a decentralized manner.
- **Military and Defense**: The decentralized nature of the system ensures that even if some drones are compromised or disconnected, the swarm can continue functioning securely and efficiently.
